# 🤖 TalentScout AI Hiring Assistant

A fully responsive, dynamic AI-powered hiring chatbot that interacts with candidates, collects their information, evaluates them based on their tech stack, and stores application data with a graceful UI/UX. Built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenRouter's LLM, this project demonstrates practical integration of conversational AI for intelligent hiring workflows.

## 📌 Features

- 🔁 **One-question-at-a-time interaction** for a smooth conversational experience  
- 🎯 **Tech stack-based dynamic interview questions** using LLM (Mistral via OpenRouter)  
- ✅ **Review and edit answers** before final submission  
- 💾 **Application data stored locally** as JSON file  
- ⚠️ **Graceful error handling** and empty-input checks  
- 🎨 **Minimal, accessible UI with responsive styling**  
- 📩 **Final success message with polite transition** for better UX

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Used

- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit  
- **Backend & Logic**: Python  
- **AI Model**: Mistral-7B via OpenRouter API  
- **Environment Variables**: `dotenv`  
- **Data Storage**: JSON File (for candidate info)

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Starts with friendly, one-by-one questions to collect user info.
- Asks for tech stack input.
- Dynamically generates **3 smart, relevant questions** based on that tech stack using OpenRouter’s LLM.
- Allows the candidate to answer those questions.
- Saves the full conversation & application data to a local `candidates.json` file.

## 🧪 Known Limitation / Challenge (Handled Gracefully)

> **Real-time edit vs post-edit limitation**:
> - 🛠️ Basic Info (like Name, Email, etc.) can only be edited during real-time input — not at the final review page.
> - ✅ However, **technical questions** generated by the LLM *can* be reviewed and edited even at the final stage.
> 
> ✨ This limitation is an intentional design decision to preserve session integrity and prevent UI conflicts within Streamlit’s multi-step flow. Future versions may use session memory with a smarter edit state for full flexibility.

## 🔄 Flow Overview

1. Candidate enters basic information (Name, Email, etc.)
2. Candidate enters tech stack (e.g. Python, HTML, FastAPI)
3. App generates 3 custom interview questions using OpenRouter API
4. Candidate answers them one by one (with edit option)
5. Final review page shows all inputs with **edit+submit**
6. Submission triggers a success message and stores data in `candidates.json`

- Managing **Streamlit rerun state** between inputs and LLM responses
- Debugging **conditional edit logic** across session state
- Ensuring a consistent experience between **local development** and **cloud deployment**
- UI styling with Streamlit’s limited customization layer
